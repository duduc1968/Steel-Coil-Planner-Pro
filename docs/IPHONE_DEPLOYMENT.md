This web app cannot be opened directly from a ZIP on iPhone as a live app.
It must run on a server.

1. Local PC server on same Wi-Fi:
   - run `python -m uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
   - open from iPhone using the PC IP address.

2. Cloud server:
   - deploy to Render, Railway, Fly.io, VPS, or similar.
   - open the public HTTPS link on iPhone Safari.
   - use Share → Add to Home Screen.

For real onboard use, HTTPS cloud hosting is recommended.
